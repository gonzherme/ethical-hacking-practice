* MAC Adress: media access control
- It's permanent, physical, unique to a device
- It's an address assigned to network interfaces by the device manufacturer

It corresponds to the network device that you connect to a computer that allows it to connect to the internet.

In the same way the IP address identifies devices in the internet, the MAC address identifies devices within a given network.

* Network
Within a network, any packet of information you want to send must contain a:
   - Source MAC address
   - Destination MAC address


* Why change the MAC address
1. Increase anonymity
2. Allows you to impersonate the device you change your MAC address to

This allows you to bypass filters

* How to change MAC address
Note: 'ifconfig' command gives you info on the devices connected to your network
